Working Test Case Analysis

Test: test_transform_data
Scenario: Valid data transformation with correct week grouping

What's Working Correctly

Week Calculation
Correctly groups Saturday (2022-12-31) and Sunday (2023-01-01) into the same week (starting 2022-12-26).
Handles time boundaries (e.g., 23:59:59 vs. 00:00:00) without splitting weeks incorrectly.
Aggregation Logic
Total Calls: Counts records per user/week accurately (user1=2, user2=1).
Practice Days: Correctly counts distinct days (Dec 31 + Jan 1 = 2 days for user1).
Averages:
Computes avg_duration_per_day properly ((3600+1800)/2 = 2700s → 45 mins).
Calculates calls_per_day as total_calls/practice_days (e.g., 2/2 = 1.0).
Schema Matching
Output schema aligns with expectations (columns, data types, nullable flags).
Why It Works

Input Data: Clean, with no nulls/malformed values.
Time Handling: Assumes consistent timezone (likely UTC) in calculations.
Business Logic: Matches the expected behavior for valid cases.


Empty Schema Tests

What's Working
✅ Empty Input DataFrame

Correctly handles empty input DataFrames with the expected schema.
Returns an empty DataFrame with the proper output schema.
Why It Matters

Ensures the pipeline doesn't fail on empty inputs (common in production).
Validates schema consistency even with no data.

NEED TO WORK ON THESE TEST CASES 


1. Week Start Date Mismatch

Failure:

Expected week starts on 2022-12-26 (Sunday), but got 2022-12-25 18:00:00 (timezone-adjusted Saturday).
Fix:
Ensure week calculations use Sunday as the start day consistently.
Explicitly set the Spark timezone to UTC to avoid timezone surprises.
Use date_trunc('week', ...) or next_day() functions to align with business rules.

2. Null Values Not Filtered

Failure:

Records with null in critical fields (user_name, start_date_time) are processed.
Fix:
Filter out nulls early in the transformation:
Drop rows where user_name or start_date_time is null.
Handle total_duration nulls/negatives separately.

3. Week Boundary Calculation Errors

Failure:

Data spanning week boundaries (e.g., Saturday-to-Sunday) is grouped incorrectly.
Fix:
Define a clear week-start rule (e.g., "Weeks start on Sunday").
Use date arithmetic (e.g., next_day(date, 'Sunday') - 7 days) to align boundaries.

4. Negative Durations Not Handled

Failure:

Negative total_duration values are included in averages.
Fix:
Validate durations before processing:
Filter out rows where total_duration <= 0.
Log warnings for invalid values if needed.

5. Malformed Dates Processed

Failure:

Invalid date strings (e.g., "not-a-date") are not filtered.
Fix:
Safely parse dates and discard unparseable rows:
Use to_timestamp() with error handling.
Filter rows where parsed date is null.

6. Single-User Multi-Week Aggregation

Failure:

Tests expect 3 weeks of data for a user, but some weeks are missing.
Fix:
Verify grouping logic for weekly aggregation:
Ensure week_start is calculated correctly for all records.
Check that countDistinct() is used for practice_days.
